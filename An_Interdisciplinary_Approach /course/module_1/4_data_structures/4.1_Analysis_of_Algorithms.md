# 4.1 Analysis of Algorithms

## Introduction
When we write a program, it is essential not only to make it work correctly but also to **pay attention to its cost** — how much time and resources it consumes. Understanding and analyzing the performance of algorithms allows us to design more efficient programs and make informed decisions between different approaches.

To study the cost of running a program, we examine our programs scientifically and mathematically. This involves using the **scientific method** to observe, hypothesize, and test, as well as applying **mathematical analysis** to derive concise models of cost.

## The Scientific Method
The scientific method provides a structured way to study the behavior and performance of algorithms. It can be summarized in **five key steps**:

1. **Observe** some feature of the natural world (in this case, the behavior of a program).
2. **Hypothesize** a model that is consistent with the observations.
3. **Predict** events or outcomes using the hypothesis.
4. **Verify** the predictions by making further observations or experiments.
5. **Validate** the results by repeating the process until the hypothesis and observations agree.

Each experiment must be **reproducible**, and each hypothesis must be **falsifiable** — meaning it can be tested and proven wrong if incorrect. This ensures that our conclusions about an algorithm’s performance are reliable and scientific.

## Observations
Measuring the exact running time of a program is often challenging because it depends on many external factors such as the computer’s hardware, system load, and background processes. However, there are several tools to help estimate performance.

In this book, the **Stopwatch.java** data type is used to measure how long a program takes to run. The program is executed on different inputs, and the time required for each input is recorded. This process allows us to make **qualitative observations** about how the running time grows as the problem size increases.

A key insight is that every program has a **problem size** — a measure that characterizes the difficulty of its computational task. By studying how running time changes with increasing problem size, we can model and predict an algorithm’s efficiency.

## Summary
The analysis of algorithms helps us understand how efficiently our programs solve problems. By applying the scientific method and mathematical reasoning, we can measure, predict, and improve the performance of our code. Paying attention to the cost of computation is a fundamental principle of good programming practice.
