## Elements of Programing

### ðŸŸ¢ 1.3 Conditionals and Loops

- **Control Flow:** The order in which statements are executed in a program.
- In basic programs, each statement runs **once** in order, but most programs require **variable execution sequences**.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ If Statements

- Allow programs to perform **different actions for different inputs**.
- **Example:** Exchange two integers so that **x** holds the smaller and **y** holds the larger.
- **Flip.java:** Uses `Math.random()` with an **if-else** to simulate a coin flip.
- **Use Cases:** Decision-making such as login validation, error handling, or branching logic.

**Example (Physical):** A **traffic light system** that changes actions based on the signal (stop, go, slow).  
**Example (Cybersecurity):** An **access control system** granting or denying entry based on user credentials.

```

public class Flip {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // Math.random() returns a value between 0.0 and 1.0
        // so it is heads or tails 50% of the time
        if (Math.random() < 0.5) System.out.println("Heads");
        else                     System.out.println("Tails");
    }
}

Output:
    Heads
    Tails
```

---

#### ðŸ”¹ While Loops

- Used for **repetitive computations**.
- Syntax: Execute a block of code **as long as a condition is true**.
- **Example:** Find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.
- **TenHellos.java:** Prints "Hello World" 10 times using a `while`.
- **PowersOfTwo.java:** Prints all powers of 2 up to a given integer.

**Example (Physical):** A **washing machine cycle** that continues until time runs out.  
**Example (Cybersecurity):** A **password brute force attack** repeating until the correct password is found.

```
// PowersOfTwo Application:
public class PowersOfTwo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // read in one command-line argument
        int n = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);

        int i = 0;                // count from 0 to N
        int powerOfTwo = 1;       // the ith power of two

        // repeat until i equals n
        while (i <= n) {
            System.out.println(i + " " + powerOfTwo);   // print out the power of two
            powerOfTwo = 2 * powerOfTwo;                // double to get the next one
            i = i + 1;
        }

    }
}


Output:
   % java PowersOfTwo 5
   0 1
   1 2
   2 4
   3 8
   4 16
   5 32
```

#### ðŸ”¹ For Loops

- Alternate way to write loops with **flexibility and clarity**.
- Structure combines:
  - **Initialization** (set variable)
  - **Condition** (exit check)
  - **Increment/Decrement** (update variable)
- **Example:** Counting or iterating through arrays.
- **Compound assignment idioms:** `i++` is shorthand for `i = i + 1`.

**Example (Physical):** Counting rows of seats in a theater until all rows are filled.  
**Example (Cybersecurity):** Iterating through a **list of IP addresses** to scan for vulnerabilities.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ Scope

- **Scope:** The region in a program where a variable is accessible.
- Variable scope is limited to its **block of code** (defined by `{}`).
- Variables declared in a **for loop header** are considered in the same block as the loop body.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ Nesting

- **Nesting:** Placing an **if**, **while**, or **for** loop inside another.
- Used for **complex conditions** and **multi-level computations**.
- **DivisorPattern.java:** Nested loops + if-else = prints divisor patterns with asterisks.
- **MarginalTaxRate.java:** Uses **nested if-else** statements to compute tax brackets.

**Example (Physical):** A **school schedule**: each day (loop) has multiple classes (nested loops).  
**Example (Cybersecurity):** A **firewall rule system**: checks multiple conditions within larger policy sets.

**Summary:**  
Conditionals (**if / if-else**) and loops (**while / for**) are the building blocks of control flow in Java. They allow programs to make decisions, repeat tasks, manage variable scope, and handle nested logic.
