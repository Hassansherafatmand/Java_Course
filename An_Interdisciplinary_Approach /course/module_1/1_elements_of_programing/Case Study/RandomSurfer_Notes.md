# 🌐 Random Surfer Simulation – Complete Notes

## 🧭 Overview

The **Random Surfer Model** simulates a user randomly navigating the web.  
Using the **Transition Matrix** (from the previous step), it estimates how often a user lands on each page, producing a ranking of importance known as **PageRank**.

This concept is the foundation of how **Google’s PageRank algorithm** measures the popularity and authority of web pages.

## 🧩 The Core Idea

1️⃣ Start on an initial page (page 0).  
2️⃣ At each step, use the **probabilities** in the Transition Matrix to decide where to go next.  
3️⃣ Repeat this process **thousands or millions of times**.  
4️⃣ Count how many times each page is visited.  
5️⃣ Convert those counts into **probabilities** — the **PageRank**.

The longer the simulation runs, the more accurate the estimated ranks become.

## 🧮 Mathematical Concept

Each entry in the **transition matrix** `p[i][j]` represents the probability of moving **from page i → to page j**.

When the random surfer follows these probabilities over many moves, the **steady-state distribution** of visits across all pages gives us their relative importance.

Formally, if `v` is a probability vector of page visits:

\[
v_{t+1} = v_t × P
\]

After many iterations (`t → ∞`), `v` converges to a stable distribution — the **PageRank vector**.

## ⚙️ Simulation Algorithm (Monte Carlo Method)

We use a **Monte Carlo simulation** to approximate PageRank by random trials.

### Steps:

1. **Initialize variables**
   - `trials` → total number of moves (e.g., 10,000)
   - `page = 0` → starting page
   - `freq[]` → array to count visits per page

2. **For each trial:**
   - Generate a random number `r` between 0 and 1.
   - Walk through the probabilities in the current page’s row of the transition matrix.
   - When the cumulative sum exceeds `r`, move to that destination page.
   - Increment the frequency count `freq[page]`.

3. **After all trials:**
   - Convert frequencies to probabilities:  
     \[
     	ext{PageRank}[i] = rac{	ext{freq}[i]}{	ext{trials}}
     \]

## 💻 Java Implementation (Simplified Example)

```java
int trials = 10000;              // Number of moves
int page = 0;                    // Start at page 0
int[] freq = new int[n];         // Visit counts
Random rand = new Random();

for (int t = 0; t < trials; t++) {
    double r = rand.nextDouble();  // Random number 0–1
    double sum = 0.0;

    // Decide next page based on transition probabilities
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        sum += p[page][j];
        if (r < sum) {
            page = j;
            break;
        }
    }
    freq[page]++;  // Record visit
}

// Print results
System.out.println("PageRank Results:");
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    double rank = (double) freq[i] / trials;
    System.out.printf("Page %d: %.4f%n", i, rank);
}
```

## 🧠 Explanation of Key Variables

| Variable | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `p[i][j]` | double | Probability of moving from page i → to page j |
| `n` | int | Number of pages |
| `trials` | int | Total number of simulated moves |
| `page` | int | Current page position |
| `freq[i]` | int | Number of visits to page i |
| `rand` | Random | Generates random numbers for choosing next pages |
| `rank` | double | Normalized PageRank value for each page |

## 📊 Example Transition Matrix

| From\To | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|----------|---|---|---|---|---|
| **0** | 0.020 | 0.920 | 0.020 | 0.020 | 0.020 |
| **1** | 0.020 | 0.020 | 0.338 | 0.338 | 0.283 |
| **2** | 0.020 | 0.020 | 0.020 | 0.920 | 0.020 |
| **3** | 0.920 | 0.020 | 0.020 | 0.020 | 0.020 |
| **4** | 0.470 | 0.020 | 0.470 | 0.020 | 0.020 |

## 📈 Example Output (After 10,000 Trials)

```
PageRank Results:
Page 0: 0.2572
Page 1: 0.1496
Page 2: 0.2118
Page 3: 0.2927
Page 4: 0.0887
```

✅ Interpretation:
- Page **3** is most frequently visited → highest PageRank.
- Page **4** is least visited → lowest PageRank.

## 🔍 How It Works Conceptually

| Step | Description |
|------|--------------|
| 1️⃣ | Start at page 0. |
| 2️⃣ | Use the probabilities in that row to “spin a wheel” and choose the next page. |
| 3️⃣ | Record which page was chosen. |
| 4️⃣ | Repeat thousands of times. |
| 5️⃣ | The proportion of visits stabilizes → **steady-state probabilities**. |

This approach is a **stochastic simulation** — every random number represents one “click” a real user could make.

---

## 🧮 Relation to Markov Chains

The Random Surfer Model is a **Markov Chain**, meaning:

> The next state depends only on the current state, not the previous ones.

Mathematically, the transition matrix is **stochastic** (each row sums to 1.0).  
Repeated application of this matrix leads to **steady-state convergence**, where the surfer’s probability of being on each page stops changing.

---

## 🧾 Optional: Accuracy Considerations

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|---------|
| **Number of trials** | More trials → more accurate ranks |
| **Random seed** | Different seeds → slightly different results |
| **Alpha (0.9)** | Controls the balance between random jumps and real links |
| **Matrix size (n)** | Larger web → more pages to explore |

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- The Random Surfer model **simulates** real browsing behavior.  
- Repeated moves approximate a **steady probability distribution** (PageRank).  
- Teleportation prevents the surfer from getting stuck.  
- The simulation results converge to the **dominant eigenvector** of the transition matrix — the foundation of **PageRank**.
