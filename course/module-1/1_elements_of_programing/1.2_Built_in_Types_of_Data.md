## Elements of Programing

### ðŸŸ¢ Built-in Types of Data

A **data type** is a set of values and operations defined on them.  
Java has **eight built-in primitive data types**, plus the frequently used **String** type.

#### ðŸ”¹ Terminology

```java
int a, b, c;
a = 1234;
b = 99;
c = a + b;
```

- **Declaration statement**: defines variables with a type (e.g., int).
- **Assignment statements**: set values using literals and expressions.
- Example: `c` becomes 1333.

âœ… Key Idea: A variableâ€™s type defines what values and operations are allowed.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ Characters and Strings

- **char**: single alphanumeric character or symbol.
- **String**: sequence of characters.
- **Concatenation**: combine strings using `+`.

```java
String a, b, c;
a = "Hello,";
b = " Bob";
c = a + b;   // c = "Hello, Bob"
```

âœ… Key Idea: Strings can be combined with `+`.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ Integers

- **int**: whole numbers between â€“2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647.
- Support for **addition, subtraction, multiplication, division**.
- Example: `IntOps.java`.

âœ… Key Idea: Integer arithmetic is exact, but watch for **overflow**.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ Floating-point Numbers

- **double**: real numbers with decimal or scientific notation.
- Examples: `3.14159`, `6.022E23`.
- Arithmetic operators are built in.

âœ… Key Idea: Use double for real numbers and scientific calculations.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ Booleans

- **boolean**: values `true` or `false`.
- Operators:
  - `&&` (and)
  - `||` (or)
  - `!` (not)
- Defined with **truth tables**.

âœ… Key Idea: Booleans are the foundation of conditionals and logic.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ Comparisons

- Operators: `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`.
- Result: **boolean** value.
- Example: LeapYear.java uses comparisons to test calendar years.

âœ… Key Idea: Comparisons link numbers and booleans.

#### ðŸ”¹ Library Methods & APIs

**Library methods and APIs.** Many programming tasks involve using Java library methods in addition to the built-in operators. An application programming interface is a table summarizing the methods in a library.

- **Application Programming Interface (API)**: table of methods in a library.
- Examples:

  - Print strings â†’ `System.out.println()`
    ![alt text](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/11cheatsheet/images/system.out.print-api.png)

  - Convert strings â†’ `Integer.parseInt()`
    ![alt text](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/11cheatsheet/images/parse-api.png)

  - Mathatical functions â†’ `Math.sqrt()`, `Math.pow()`
    ![alt text](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/11cheatsheet/images/math-api.png)

You can call a method by typing its name followed by arguments, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas. Here are some examples:

âœ… Key Idea: Java libraries extend functionality beyond built-in operators.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ Type Conversion

- **Explicit methods**: `Math.round()`, `Integer.parseInt()`, `Double.parseDouble()`.
- **Automatic conversion**: For primitive numeric types, the system automatically performs type conversion when we use a value whose type has a larger range of values than expected. (int â†’ double).
- **Casts**: Java also has some built-in type conversion methods for primitive types that you can use when you are aware that you might lose information, but you have to make your intention using something called a cast. `(double) (3/5)`.
- **Strings**: The built-in type String obeys special rules. One of these special rules is that you can easily convert any type of data to a String by using the `+` operator.

âœ… Key Idea: Type conversion helps combine and transform data types.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ Exercises (Selected)

- **Swap values**:
  ```java
  int t = a;
  b = t;
  a = b;
  ```
- **Simplify**: `(!(a < b) && !(a > b))` â†’ `(a == b)`
- **Exclusive or (^):** true if values differ.
- **Why 10/3 = 3?** â†’ integer division, no conversion. Use `10.0/3.0`.
- **String concatenation results:**
  - `2 + "bc"` â†’ `2bc`
  - `2 + 3 + "bc"` â†’ `5bc`
  - `"bc" + 2 + 3` â†’ `bc23`

âœ… Key Idea: Practice exercises reveal edge cases of types and operators.
